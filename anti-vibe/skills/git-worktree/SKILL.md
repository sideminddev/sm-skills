# Git Worktree

Create and use Git worktrees so multiple branches can be worked on in separate directories.

**Commands (run from repo root):**
- List: `git worktree list`
- Add: `git worktree add <path> <branch>` (e.g. `git worktree add ../project-feat ../feature-branch`)
- Remove: `git worktree remove <path>` (after switching away and committing or discarding)

**Use case:** Run a separate agent or human in another branch in a different folder without touching the current branch. Each worktree has its own working directory but shares the same .git history.

**Note:** Create worktrees from the repo that contains the branch you need. Works with monorepos, multi-package repos, or simple single-folder projects.

## Branch/worktree closure discipline

When implementation in a worktree is complete, use `finishing-a-development-branch` to close with a consistent decision flow:

1. Merge locally
2. Push and create PR
3. Keep as-is
4. Discard

This avoids dangling worktrees and branch confusion.
