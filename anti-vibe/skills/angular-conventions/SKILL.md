# Angular Conventions

When working in `frontend/` (or Angular app root), follow these conventions:

- **Structure**: Feature-based; standalone components only. `core/`, `shared/`, `features/<feature>/` with components, services, models, `*-routes.ts`. Kebab-case files; PascalCase classes.
- **Error capture**: All errors must be captured: use centralized error capture in RxJS pipes, and wrap try/catch with error capture. See project rules for error-capture patterns.
- **User-facing text**: All in English.
- **TypeScript Validation**: Run `tsc --noEmit` or `npm run validate` after implementation; fix all type/lint errors. Build only when explicitly requested.
- **Lazy loading**: Use loadComponent/loadChildren for feature routes.

Reference project rules and structure docs for full details.
